## LHC Data Analysis
### Alexander Scheibe


When analyzing our LHC data, we found a ratio of 20 electrons to 18 muons – from the “e, neutrino” and “muon, neutrino” events. This analysis was adequate because the ratio of electron to muon events was supposed to be about 50/50. Continuing – for the ratio of W+/W- – we examined 35 W+ and 20 W- events. This analysis is about right because there are supposed to be a few more positive events – when compared to negative. Furthermore, when constructing our histogram for 2-lepton events, we examined a peak at around 90 GeV which would indicate Z Boson particles. Along with that, there were also two other peaks at around 3 GeV and 10 GeV. At 3 GeV, this would indicate a J/Ѱ, while the 10GeV peak would indicate an upsilon particle. For our 4-lepton events, the decays ended up with 2 Z Bosons. These could have come from the Higgs, or other processes. For possible Higg candidates, we found 9 candidates, but only 3 of the events had a mass around 125 GeV – which is the Higgs mass. With that, there were two 2 electron/2 muon decays that had a mass of 96.12 GeV and 148.72 GeV. Along with that, there was a 4-electron decay that had a mass of 154.95 GeV. In all, with our data we were able to find three Higg candidates – below there is a screenshot of one of the Higg candidate events that we ran into.
